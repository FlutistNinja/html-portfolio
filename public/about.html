<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am a game developer with a year of self-driven experience in the field.
  Although I have yet to work for a firm, I have been focusing on my own projects,
  developing games using Unity and C#. I have also been honing my graphic skills with Blender and Photoshop.
.</p>

<p>My primary objective is to continually improve myself in game programming and to create innovative ideas.
My passion for game development is fueled by various interests including bujinkan budo taijutsu, playing the flute, 
figure skating, and inline skating. I love nature, and activities such as canyoning, camping, and trekking offer me new perspectives and creative ideas.</p>

<p>Even though I donâ€™t have professional experience yet, I eagerly look forward to contributing to the gaming industry with my creativity and perpetual learning attitude.
  If you're interested in learning more about what I've done in my own game projects, please feel free to reach out.
  I am excited about the possibility of collaborating with you to create engaging games and enhance the user experience.
